  <h3> Pet Health</h3>
   <p>holiday is finally here! And for a lot of us that means getting outdoors
     and enjoying cookouts with family friends and pets.It is a great time to
     sit back and relax drink a tea and maybe set the family record for the
     number of hot dogs you can eat. But don rest too easy,there is some
      responsibility you should not ignore especially if you have pets!
      cook-on-While we are enjoying our favorite summer foods, it is
   worth keeping in mind that a lot of these tasty treats are not so good for
   our furry friends</p>
  <h3> Pete Care</h3>
   <p>While tasty, hot dogs are not the healthiest food for us humans, and
    they are even worse for pets. Hot dogs are packed with tons of salt and
     preservatives, both in levels that dogs are just not used to. Excessive
      amounts can lead to diarrhea and indigestion. It is our recommendation to
      avoid them altogether, but if you must must must give in to temptation
      and treat your dog, please exercise moderation. Also, it is helpful to cut
       them into bite-size pieces to avoid choking hazards</p>
<h3> Pet Training</h3>

   free apps to help keep you and your pup on a walking schedule</p>
